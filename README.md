# Carbon-Footprint-Calculator
Isabelle Junio's personal project. 
This project is a simple carbon footprint calculator that will be published on a small website.
Start Date: Feb 20, 2025
Status: In Progress

# Languages used:
- C++
- Either html or React to create the website

# To do: 
- Find out how to calculate someone's carbon footprint (By Feb 24)
  - Find 2 carbon footprint websites
  - Watch videos
  - variables needed
  - what variables are inputs, and which are constants
  - find the formula
  - 10%
- Prototype 1 (By Mar 3)
  - code the calculator
  - Test in Terminal
    - Does it run?
    - Are the results similar to the results of other carbon footprint calculators?
    - What's the runtime?
  - You can always tweak the formatting just in case it doesn't align with coding for a website
  - 20%
- Research how to create a website (By Mar 10)
  - Watch videos using React with c++
  - Watch videos on how to use Figma
  - Watch videos on how to connect React to Figma
  - Ask friends with experience: Nico, Payge, Leo, Jaafar, Taylor, Ariadne
  - 10%
- Design on Figma (By Mar 17)
  - Let other people look at your design (Sam, Kate, Diya, CJ, Ariadne)
    - Do they understand what the website is used for
    - Is it easy to use?
  - 20%
- Implement on React or using HTML
  -  Write down more detailed steps once you know more about how this works!
